# Simple Address Book Manager

This is a simple web application that allows you to manage a list of contacts, including adding, editing, and deleting contacts. You can also filter the list of contacts by name or mobile number.
## Getting Started

Usage
## Adding a Contact

To add a contact, fill out the form at the top of the page with the contact's name and mobile number, then click the "Add Contact" button. If a contact with the same mobile number already exists, an error message will be displayed and the contact will not be added.
## Editing a Contact

To edit a contact, click the "Edit" button next to the contact you wish to edit. This will populate the form at the top of the page with the contact's current information. Make any desired changes, then click the "Update Contact" button to save the changes.
## Deleting a Contact

To delete a contact, click the "Delete" button next to the contact you wish to delete. This will remove the contact from the list of contacts.
## Filtering Contacts

To filter the list of contacts, simply type a search term into the search box at the top of the page. The list of contacts will be filtered to show only contacts whose names or mobile numbers contain the search term.

Note that the search is a phrase search, meaning that you can enter any part of the name or mobile number to find a match. For example, typing "Jo" will match contacts with names like "John" or "Joanna".
